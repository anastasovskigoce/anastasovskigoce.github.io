      <description>I have been working as a Mobile Developer since 2014 and I currently lead a team of several mobile engineers. Most of my carrier was spent on an app that lets you control IoT devices and some part of my career was spent working on a banking app. In my free time, I am either working on side projects or conference talks. Check out my GitHub page or my conferences section for more details.</description>
