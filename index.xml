      <description>I have been working as a Mobile Developer since 2014. Initially I started as a junior developer, transitioned through all the senior roles and currently I lead a team of 8 Android and iOS engineers. I spent most of my carrier working on an app that lets you control IOT devices and some part of my career was spent working on Capital Ones banking app. In my free time I am working on an app that provides the user with daily motivational quotes.</description>
